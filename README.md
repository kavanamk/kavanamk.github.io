## PROJECTS 

**Obesity Level Classification (R)** | Collected, cleaned, and pre-processed data. Applied PCA and K-Means clustering. 92.95% accuracy using Decision Trees with pruning and KNN tuned for optimal k values.

**Text Classification (Python, NLTK)** | Built a sentiment analysis pipeline using Bag of Words and TF-IDF with a Logistic Regression classifier. Trained on 2,000 samples and achieved 84.37% accuracy.

**Heart Failure Prediction (Python, scikit-learn)** | Implemented SVM (with grid search), Decision Trees, and ensemble methods including Random Forest, Bagging, and Boosting. Developed a weighted voting ensemble model that reached 88% accuracy.

**Autism Screening (Python, scikit-learn)** | Applied Mutual Information and Recursive Feature Elimination for feature selection. Evaluated models including XGBoost, SVM (RBF), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and MLP using GridSearchCV. Achieved 97.2% cross-validation accuracy and 1.0 sensitivity with SVM-RBF.

**Generative AI** | TensorFlow 2 in the cloud. Gained hands-on experience with Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Variational Autoencoders, GAN, LLM and transformer-based NLP models. Projects included image generation, style transfer, deepfake creation, music composition, and game agent training using GAIL.

**Distributed File Retrieval Engine (Java, ZeroMQ, Multithreading, Ubuntu)** |  Built a distributed client-server file retrieval system using Java and ZeroMQ. Implemented multithreaded server with dispatcher/worker threads for concurrent requests. Designed centralised text indexing and ranked TF-based search.Evaluated scalability and performance using Linux VM on Chameleon Cloud.

**Gym DBMS (Java, JDBC, SQLite, Swing)** | Developed an interactive desktop application for gym membership management. Implemented full CRUD operations with local database storage via JDBC.

**MVC Audio/Video Store App (Java, Design Patterns)** | Created a media store desktop GUI using MVC architecture. Applied classic design patterns to handle user interaction, model updates, and UI display.
